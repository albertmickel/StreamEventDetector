# StreamEventDetector

Several notes:

- This is a demo-only code to show how to solve a home project for event detection.
- Since we have limited time (4~6 hrs) and have no powerful gpu, except for using free service gpu, like colab, we will have to select the simplest solution as used in this demo.
- The performance of this solution would be OK, or say, medium, which should roughtly solve the problem. The expected accuracy would be around 80% or higher, depending on the amount of the labelled data samples. The more, the better!
- If we are given more GPUs, I would go for other more complicated solutions, e.g, using the pretrained model. However, it would surely require multiples GPUs and more stable GPU service (colab is not the stable one!)
- we need to manually label a dataset for training/dev/testing. This part would require a plenty of time. The idea is that the more labelled data, the better. However, for demo purpose, a small example set with several labeled samples would be enough!
